- 👋 Hi, I’m Sam Mardazad.
- 👀 I’m currently a PhD student at the chair of Ulrich Schollwöck in Munich, focussed on the developement of tensor networks methods for strongly correlated materials and its application to Quantum Chemistry problems.
- 🌱 My focus is C++, but I have also strong experience in python.
- 🏎 Doing a lot of HPC & MPI.
- 🤩 I'm kind of old skool, so I love bash.
- 🙃 I've got some experience in container software.
- 😊 Our chair toolkit is not open source, nevertheless there are some useful little tools which are disentangled from it and which I would like to share here.
