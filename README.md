- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sam Mardazad.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently a PhD student at the chair of Ulrich SchollwÃ¶ck in Munich, focussed on the developement of tensor networks methods for strongly correlated materials and its application to Quantum Chemistry problems.
- ğŸŒ± My focus is C++, but I have also strong experience in python.
- ğŸ¤© I'm kind of old skool, so I love bash.
- ğŸ™ƒ I've got some experience in container software.
- ğŸ˜Š Our chair toolkit is not open source, nevertheless there are some useful little tools which are disentangled from it and which I would like to share here.
