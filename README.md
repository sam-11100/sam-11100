- 👋 Hi, I’m Sam Mardazad.
- 👀 I did my PhD at the chair of Ulrich Schollwöck in Munich, focussed on the developement of tensor networks methods for strongly correlated materials and its application to Quantum Chemistry problems.
- 😎 Right now I am a post-doc in the group of Adrian Kantian in Edinburgh, focussed on the implementation of multi node tensor network applications for the simulation of quantum materials and molecules.
- 🌱 My focus is C++, but I have also strong experience in python.
- 🏎 Doing a lot of HPC & MPI.
- 🤩 I'm kind of old skool, so I love bash.
- 🥰 I am in love with LaTeX.
- 🙃 I've got some experience in container software, in particular with singularity.
- 😊 The syten toolkit is not open source, nevertheless there are some useful little tools which are disentangled from it and which I would like to share here. Furthermore, you can obtain the singularity container version of the toolkit for HPC setups at [syten.eu](https://syten.eu).
